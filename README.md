# 100 Days of Data Science

This repository is a collection of my daily learnings and activities as I embark on a journey to become a data scientist from scratch. I have been "hired" by a fictional company called Keko Corp, where I will be diving into various aspects of data science, data engineering, data analytics, and data warehousing.

## Repository Structure

Each day is documented with detailed explanations, code snippets, and examples. The topics covered range from basic Python programming to advanced data visualization,data engineering, data warehousing, machine learning, deep learning and linear algebra concepts.


## How to Use This Repository

Each day's work is documented in a separate markdown file within this repository. You can navigate through the files to follow along with my learning process, see the code examples, and understand the concepts being covered.
